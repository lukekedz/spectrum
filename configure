password length?
config/initializers/devise.rb:
config.password_length = 10..128

Next, you need to set up the default URL options for the Devise mailer in each environment. Here is a possible configuration for config/environments/development.rb:
config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { host: 'localhost', port: 3000 }

Devise will create some helpers to use inside your controllers and views. To set up a controller with user authentication, just add this before_action (assuming your devise model is 'User'):
before_action :authenticate_user!

To verify if a user is signed in, use the following helper:
user_signed_in?

For the current signed-in user, this helper is available:
current_user

You can access the session for this scope:
user_session

root to: 'home#index'
